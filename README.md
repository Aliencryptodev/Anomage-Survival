## Run locally

Use a local static server (don‚Äôt open with `file://` to avoid CORS):

```bash
# Python
python -m http.server 8080

# Node
npx serve .
Open http://localhost:8080.

If assets/Sprites.json fails due to CORS, the game shows a warning and falls back to default paths.
You can also click ‚ÄúCargar Sprites.json‚Ä¶‚Äù to load a JSON manually.

Quick customization
Joystick & RUN positioning: edit CSS in index.html

css
Copy code
/* Movement (left) */
#joyL   { left:18px;  bottom:120px; }
/* Aim/Shoot (right) */
#joyR   { right:140px; bottom:120px; }
/* RUN button (right side) */
#btnRunR{ right:20px;  bottom:120px; }
Spell balance: tweak makeProj() in game.js (damage, pierce, AoE, effects).

Fire rate & mana cost: adjust fireCd in Player and SHOT_MANA_COST.

Performance tips
Keep your browser up to date.

Close heavy tabs if FPS drops.

Use regular device resolutions; the canvas scales with image-rendering: pixelated.
